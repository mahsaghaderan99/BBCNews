Language model neural network artichecture is adopt from \href{https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model}{pytorch/examples} project. Tokenizer codes and models are replaced with Part 2 and vocab for Language Modeling is construct in part 2. In this part the corpus is divided into three part, train set, dev set and test set. LanguageModel is trained on each label separately to evaluate capability of each model to generate specific news. Models are saved in "models/lm" directory.
